# urlShortner

Framework used is .NetCore 3.1 and Blazor UI framework.
Mongo db(NoSql) used for performance and scalability.
 

Things to Improve If more time
--------------------------------

More Unit tests and more commenting.

Implement caching. - Once the user creates a short url, there is a greater chance that the user will test it. 
So it might be a better option to cache the values(short and long urls) once the short url is created with an expiry time.

Think about more scalable options.
